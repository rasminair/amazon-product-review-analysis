# Amazon Product Review Analysis<br>
<p><b>A data-driven analysis of Amazon product reviews using topic modeling and sentiment scoring to reveal what customers value most.</b></p>
<h3>Business Problem & Project Objective:</h3>
<p>Amazon receives an enormous volume of customer reviews across thousands of products. These reviews offer valuable insights about user experiences, product quality, common issues, and customer expectations. However, the scale and unstructured nature of this text data make it difficult to identify the key themes hidden within the feedback.</p>
<p>The goal of this project is to build an automated Topic Modeling and Sentiment Analysis system that extracts and classifies the main themes in Amazon product reviews. By uncovering the dominant topics and overall sentiment, this analysis supports better product recommendations, enhances search relevance, and helps identify opportunities for product improvement.</p>
<p>This project demonstrates how natural language processing can transform large volumes of unstructured Amazon review text into actionable insights. By combining topic modeling, sentiment analysis, and visual exploration, the analysis highlights what customers value most—and which issues impact their satisfaction.</p>
